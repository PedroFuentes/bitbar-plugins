# BitBar Plugins
This repo has a collection of [BitBar](https://getbitbar.com/) plugins that I expect to contribute to the [BitBar Plugins](https://github.com/matryer/bitbar-plugins) Repo.

##Plugin List
* `PagerDuty On Call` - shows who is on call for all the active Escalation Policies and what services have active incidents.
* `PagerDuty Incidents`- shows all the services with an active incident.
